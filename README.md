# Probability of Developing Cancer Dashboard

> An interactive dashboard that displays the probability of developing cancer by year, sex, and cancer type in the province of BC ðŸ“ˆ


## Overview 

The dashboard was developed as part of a Masters of Public Health (MPH) practicum project and is for demonstration purposes. Official and more up-to-date data can be found on the [BC Cancer website](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/health-info/disease-system-statistics).

## Background
Cancer is the leading cause of death for Canadians, and the lifetime probability of developing cancer is commonly used as a statistic in national level surveillance reports. The latest data estimates that 1 in 2 Canadians will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime, but little is known about the stability of this estimate.
This project analyzed the lifetime probability estimate over time, by sex and cancer type. This app is a product of some of this work and represents a snapshot of data that can be used interactively.


## How to use the app

* Visit the 'Info' tab on the left sidebar for information about the project and calculations.
* Use the 'Lifetime Probability' tab to display the text and waffle chart.
* From the left sidebar, select a year, sex, and cancer type.
* The text and waffle chart will automatically update with the results for the variables selected.
* You can select more than one sex or cancer type. Note: the waffle chart will display the cumulative probability but this may not be an accurate representation.
* Use the 'Datatable' tab to compare lifetime probability for different cancer types and sex.
